# and uncomment the line
# yourval = "<flaky-validator-id>"
# When a lot of validators miss a block, it is not your fault. if you alone or only a handful missed,
# you should look into your setup. Set alertIfLessThan to the max number of validators missing a block you'd tolerate
# before you'd want to be alerted. If you set it to 0, you will never get an alert.

# Output to stdout is
# "block height, proposer ID, number of validators that missed the block"
# If your val missed the block, it appends "(including your validator)."
# If the number of validators that missed is below your threshold (alertIfLessThan)
# it will further append "X validators missed, below your threshold of Y"
